1) What do you expect (and like) to learn in this class?
2) If we have time at the end of the semester to go through additional topics related to software engineering,
Java or object-oriented programming, what would you like us cover?

1)More about how to make efficient programs. And overall becoming a better programmer

2)Machine learning would be cool to learn more about.
